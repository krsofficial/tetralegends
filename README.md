# Notes
- (Pressure) Backpedalling was impossible to replicate on Tetra Legends.
- (Sudden-AE) Cyclone was impossible to replicate on Tetra Legends. To compensate, Master Pikii II (frozen minos from level 1300+) has been made harsher than the original.
- If it says 404 site not found, the site is not down, just updating.
